function sim = gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma)
%RBFKERNEL returns a radial basis function kernel between x1 and x2
%   sim = gaussianKernel(x1, x2) returns a gaussian kernel between x1 and x2
%   and returns the value in sim

% Ensure that x1 and x2 are column vectors
x1 = x1(:); x2 = x2(:);

% We need to return the following variables correctly.
sim = 0;
diff = x1-x2;
diff = diff.^2;
sim = exp(-(sum(diff))/(2 * sigma^2));

% Fill in this function to return the similarity between x1
% and x2 computed using a Gaussian kernel with bandwidth
% sigma
